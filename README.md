# Blinker

### What Is It? 
**Blinker** is a console-based social networking app written in Java. It allows a user to create a profile and make "friends" with other users on the network. The user's profile is stored in an object which is assigned a hash value to store it in a hash table. As the user makes friends on the app, an undirected graph keeps track of the friends that the user added to create a network of links between each person on the app. This allows the app to generate a list of recommended friends that is tailored based on the user's current friends. This list of recommended friends is generated through an implementation of a breadth-first search that iterates through the undirected graph. 

### Why Was It Made? 
Honestly, it was a final project for a data structures class. BUT, I saw the potential to make it a simple social networking app that will eventually (I'm trying to make a web app from this) allow users to connect with one another based on their recommended friends. Once you are friends with someone you will be able to access their profile which will display their friend's list as well as links (I'm currently adding this feature) to their social media profiless  

### More Info...
There is a **UML** attached to break down the app itself. It helped me, and hopefully does the same for you, visualize the app and how each function, object, and data structure are linked to one another. Also, **_ALL_ of the data structures** (apart from the hash table) that you see were ones that I created from scratch with the help of a textbook (_[Data Structures and Abstractions With Java](https://www.amazon.com/Data-Structures-Abstractions-Java-4th/dp/0133744051) - Frank M. Carrano_). The **hash table and function** were created with the help of Rob Edwards's YouTube lecture series called [Data Structures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgCnMvvw6Oo&list=PLpPXw4zFa0uKKhaSz87IowJnOTzh9tiBk). The **breadth-first search algorithm** was also created with the help of external sources such as [Geek for Geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/breadth-first-search-or-bfs-for-a-graph/) and [Baeldung](https://www.baeldung.com/java-graphs). At the moment, the app is console-based but I'm working on a method of transpiling the Java code to Javascript to create a web app that will allow users from all over the world to interact with one another. I'm hoping to publish the final product (web app) by the _end of 2020_.
